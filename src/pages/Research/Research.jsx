      <h3 className='paragraph-tab'>One of the research areas in Software Engineering that I am currently studying is the processes and tools revolving around <span className='color'>the Development Workflow</span>. During the last two years of my bachelor's degree, I worked part time as a programmer and then as a technical product manager in the industry. This experience taught me that the Software Engineering process gets more complicated by day (CI/CD, code review, testing, new technologies, frameworks and etc), and therefore, creating tools that assist developers in their workflow can be really helpful. The introduction of AI Assistants and LLMs in recent years brings so many possibilities in researching ways to enable software engineers to create faster and higher quality code.</h3>

In this paper, I perform data analysis on eye tracking data from students before and after watching SFVs (short form videos eg. TikToks) to find out what effect does watching SFVs have on their cognition and eye metrics such as pupil diameter, fixation count and fixation duration.
